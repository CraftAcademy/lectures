####The Benefits of Automated Testing

- **Automation Eliminates Human Error** – An automated test will perform the test the same way every time. No steps will be overlooked or misinterpreted.

- **Automation Ensures the Test Suite is Up to Date** – As the platform grows the test suite can become out of date as changes come through. Changes to the system will be reflected quickly in the Automation results and highlight the areas that require maintenance.

- **Automation Speeds Up Testing** – Automated Test Tools can run through tests much quicker than a manual Tester. This reduces the amount of time it takes to complete a Test suite.

- **Automated Tests Can Be Run at Any Time** – Automated tests can be run outside of normal office hours. A large suite of tests can run overnight or on weekends or at anytime when a manual tester is not available.

- **Automation Allows for More Effective Use of Test Resources** – The time taken to run tests is reduced. The quality of the software and testing process is more reliable and can be easily repeated. This frees up the Testers to concentrate on finding the more complex bugs through ad hoc and exploratory testing.

- **Automated Tests Can Be Reused** – Test scripts can be written to be agnostic of the device/platform they are running against. These scripts can then be reused. Also the UI may change but the scripts should hold up if the underlying behaviour is still the same.

- **Automated Testing Compliments Continuous Integration** – An Automated Test suite can be included in the project’s Continuous Integration. For example a suite of regression tests can be kicked off after the nightly build, allowing the team to easily check the stability of the build the next day.
