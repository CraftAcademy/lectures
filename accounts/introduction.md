### Introduction
We will be building a simple rails application with a React js front end. 

This lecture aims to showcase how you can benefit from the power of a rails back-end and a modern javascript framework for front end. During this lecture we will be covering a broad variety of topics including the domain model, development workflow, authentication, version control, automated testing and many more aspects that are common in many software development projects.

Parts of the lecture are inspierd by an excellent blogpost by Fernando Villalobos titled React.js - A guide for Rails developers that you can find on: https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers
